# Text-Based-Search-Engine

A Simple Text-Based Search Engine
As you know, most of the information you need is provided by internet search engines. One of the most preferred search engines is still Google. The fundamental factors behind the success of Google are quickness and correctness. How does Google retrieve quick and correct results for user queries? In this assignment, you will investigate the answers of this question. You will develop a simple text-based search engine. Your program only operates on text files that are kept in a single directory. We will provide necessary text documents into our document database.
In this assignment, you are expected to implement a hashing algorithm in Java to index words of documents given in X. You must read these documents, split it word by word, and index each word to your hash table according to rules given below. After insertion of all documents, the user will query for a sentence that contains 3 words splitted by a single space. Your algorithm must bring most relevant document for the query written by the user.
